## Welcome to the Cronica IT&C project!

**Cronica IT&C** is a non-governmental, non-profit project initiated by
the Group of Romanian Unix Users (GURU).

### Aims

The project aims at **reconstitution and long-term preservation
of the IT&C history in Romania**, 
presented in an international context.

### Content

The content is structured around a timeline and an archive.

The timeline consists of dated **Events** (Evenimente),
described through more or less detailed articles and followed 
by references.

The archive includes a **Memories** (Amintiri) section, with
personal posts of those involved in various events, and the 
**Archive** (Arhiva) section, with various PDF documents and other 
binary documents.
