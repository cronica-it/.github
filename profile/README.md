## Welcome to the Cronica IT&C project!

**Cronica IT&C** is a non-governmental, non-profit project initiated by
the Group of Romanian Unix Users (GURU).

### Aims

The project aims at **long-term reconstitution and preservation
of the IT&C history in Romania**, 
presented in an international context.

### Content

described through more or less detailed articles and followed 
by references.

Additionally, in the **Memories** (Amintiri) section, articles with
personal information of those involved in various events are published.

Various PDF documents and other binary documents are in the **Archive**
